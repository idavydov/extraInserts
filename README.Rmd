## Description

The purpose of this trivial package is to offer a set of convenience functions inserting various (pipe) operators so those can be conveniently linked to keyboard shortcuts in [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/).

This package was developed for fun and to conveniently transport frequently used functions across environments. 

### Available operators

| **`->`**      | Rightwards form of the [common assignment operator][1]                                 |

| **`%T>%`**    | The _tee operator_ from the [magrittr][2] package                                      |
